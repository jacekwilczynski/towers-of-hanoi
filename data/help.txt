    OBJECTIVE
=================
    Your goal is to move all disks from the leftmost peg to the rightmost one.
    
    RULES:
	    1. Thou shalt move only one disk at a time.
	    2. Thou shalt only move the topmost disk from each peg
	    3. Thou shalt not place a bigger disk on top of a smaller disk.
	    
	To score higher:
	    - play with more disks (biggest weight when calculating total score)
	    - use fewer moves (average weight)
	    - be quicker (smallest weight)

===================
    
    All input is case-insensitive.
    
    MOVING DISKS:
        To try to move a disk, type a disk number or a peg letter followed by
        another disk number or a peg letter. Examples:
            2c - try to move disk 2 onto peg C
            23 - try to put disk 2 on top of disk 3
            ab - try to take the top disk from peg A and put it on peg B 
            a2 - try to take the top disk from peg A and put it on top of disk 2

        If you are brave enough to play with more than 9 disks and want to refer
	   to a disk with a two-digit number, separate both values with a hyphen:
            24-c  - try to move disk 24 onto peg C
            10-11 - try to put disk 10 on top of disk 10
            c-a   - try to take the top disk from peg C and put it on peg A
            b-13  - try to take the top disk from peg B and put it on top of
                    disk 13
    
    USING AUTO-SOLVE:
        If you want to make a move that isn't currently possible and you want
        the program to do all the steps for you, preceed the command with
        "solve":
            solve 5c - do what you need to do move disk 5 to peg C
        To solve the whole puzzle, type:
            solve all
        You will be asked to confirm every movement.
        Note that if you use the auto-solve feature, your score will not be
        saved.
        
    OTHER COMMANDS:
        menu - show the main menu (does not lose the current game)
        exit - leave the program immediately
